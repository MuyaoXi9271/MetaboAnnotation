High level functions to assist in annotation of (metabolomics) data sets. These
include functions to perform simple tentative annotations based on mass matching
but also functions to consider m/z and retention times for annotation of LC-MS
features given that respective reference values are available. In addition, the
function provides high-level functions to simplify matching of LC-MS/MS spectra
against spectral libraries and objects and functionality to represent and manage
such matched data.
